[[A variable is a way to assign a name to something.

Variables can come in the form of multiple types: strings, numbers, booleans, tables, functions, and much more!

In the first section, you declared the variable "newVariable" as a string "testVariable"; a string is usually a phrase or non-numeric set of characters.

The print function simply outputs the variables in the console. The console is what you see on the right of the screen.

When you're ready to continue, press next at the bottom of your screen.

[[local newPhrase = "This is a string"

print(newPhrase)
print(newNumber)

]], [["This is a string"

]]),
